 Java-OOP-SoftUni February 2020

The Java OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build hierarchies of classes. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
